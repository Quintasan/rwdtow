# Web Application Security

Frameworks do a great job by not only simplifying our web app code but also by silently providing some security restrictions and best practices in our apps. But this magic security works only while you do everything by default. When you start to do some "advanced" coding, you need to where common web apps vulnerability is hidden and where you need to take care of it.

Common things are:

* SQL injection: unfiltered parameter put into raw SQL query. A hacker can do malicious SQL query.
* CSRF: hacker can force/cheat some user of your app to submit form inside your app with fake data
* XSS: hacker can submit malicious JavaScript into e.g. comments on your site and steal session data of other users via this JavaScript

There are a lot more potentially dangerous things. You can find more info with details on OWASP website.
