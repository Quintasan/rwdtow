# Style guide and style checker

While Ruby does not have a lot of curly brackets `{}`, code style issues are not so sharp as in languages like PHP. But in any case we an write code with different paddings, spaces and line breaks. To avoid confusion and continuos fixes in your team code - you should adopt some styleguide. All team members should be agree and follow it.

Also there are tools like RuboCop that can make automatic static code analysis and propose fixes or recommendations.
