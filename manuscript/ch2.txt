# My Dream Stack

Before I'll start with any detailed decriptions let's have a brief look on "ideal" Ruby web application stack, that I am trying to achieve in my work. Not everything is applied yet, but "viam supervadet vadens" - a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

* Linux based OS with RubyMine IDE
* PostgreSQL DB and Redis cache
* Hanami.rb framework to have full-featured framework with as little magic as possible
* Trailblazer to organize business logic and reusable widgets, plus handle JSON API conversions.
* Dependency injection in Ruby code
* Minitest and Capybara for test, with clear OOP approaches instead of DSL
* Vue.js + ES6/WebPack for rich JavaScript pages
* Docker for local development and production deploy
