# My Dream Stack

Before I start with any detailed descriptions, let us have a brief look at the "ideal" Ruby web application stack that I am trying to achieve in my work. Not everything is available yet, but "viam supervadet vadens" â€“ a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

* Linux based OS with RubyMine IDE
* PostgreSQL DB and Redis cache
* Hanami.rb framework, to have a full-featured framework with as little magic as possible
* Trailblazer to organize business logic and reusable widgets, plus handle JSON API conversions
* Dependency injection in Ruby code
* Minitest and Capybara for testing, with clear OOP approaches instead of a DSL
* Vue.js + ES6/WebPack for rich JavaScript pages
* Docker for local development and production deployment
