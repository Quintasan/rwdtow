While Ruby does not have a lot of curly brackets `{}`, code style issues are not as painful as languages like PHP. In any case, we can write code with different paddings, spaces, and line breaks. To avoid confusion and repeated whitespace changes in your codebase - you should adopt a style guide. All team members should agree upon it.

Also, there are tools like RuboCop that can make automatic static code analysis and propose fixes or recommendations.
