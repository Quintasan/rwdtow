# Contributing to "Ruby Web Dev: The Other Way"

As the main contributor of this guide, I really appreciate your help in making it better. Thank you!
Here is a short set of rules and recommendation to follow in your contribution:


* Keep close to American English spelling (it is not a strict rule, as it is a challenge for me :) )
* Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)
* Use language agnostic urls when referring to external websites
* Open an issue with a discussion for new guide sections
